<h1Laptop Price Prediction with Machine Learning</h1>
This project aims to predict the prices of laptops based on their features using machine learning techniques. The increasing diversity and complexity of laptop specifications make it challenging for consumers to determine fair prices. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, this project offers a solution to this problem by predicting laptop prices accurately.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project comprises various features of laptops, including but not limited to:

Processor type and speed
RAM size
Storage capacity (HDD/SSD)
Graphics card
Screen size and resolution
Brand
Operating system
Weight
Battery life
Approach
We adopt a supervised learning approach, where historical data on laptop specifications and prices are used to train our machine learning models. The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, categorical variables, and outliers. Several regression algorithms such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting are explored and evaluated to determine the best-performing model.

Evaluation Metrics
To assess the performance of our models, we employ various evaluation metrics including Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared. These metrics provide insights into the accuracy and reliability of our price predictions.

Deployment
The trained machine learning model is deployed using a Streamlit web application, providing users with an intuitive interface to input laptop specifications and receive price predictions in real-time. Streamlit offers an easy-to-use framework for building interactive web applications with Python. The application allows users to dynamically adjust laptop features and instantly view predicted prices. To deploy the application:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the necessary dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file.
Run the Streamlit application locally by executing streamlit run app.py in your terminal.
Access the application through your web browser at the provided URL.
By utilizing Streamlit, we ensure a seamless and responsive user experience, making it simple for users to interact with our machine learning model and obtain accurate price predictions for laptops.

Usage
To use the application:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the necessary dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file.
Run the Streamlit application locally by executing streamlit run app.py in your terminal.
Access the application through your web browser at the provided URL.
